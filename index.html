We currently have a few games in development:
</p><br><br>
<h3 class="text_element header">Die Time</h1>
<p class="text_element body">Die Time is a thrilling top-down shooter game developed by Acorn Studios that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The game challenges you to kill enemies, find a clock, and lock your soul to it. Once you die, the clock grants you a new power, then shatters due to over-exertion. Keep going until you reach the exit, which is a ladder disappearing into the ceiling. But before you can reach it, a menacing boss blocks the way! You must use your newly acquired powers to defeat the boss and leave this unholy place. Are you up for the challenge? Good luck!
</p><br><br>
<h3 class="text_element header">Unnamed Multiplayer Game</h1>
<p class="text_element body">Join your friends in this multiplayer-party-skill frenzy! Build a level to troll, spite, or annoy your friends; but watch out, they have levels of their own! Battle your friends in arenas of your own creation and earn points for kills. Then buy more deadly treats for your own levels with the points you earn. The more rounds there are, the more points you get. How will you kill your friends?
